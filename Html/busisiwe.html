                                                My name is Busisiwe Magae but im mostly reffered to as Entle which is half of my other name, Kagoentle.
                                                I was born and bred in South Africa, Pretoria and never really moved until i moved to Mauritius. 
                                                I am currently pursuing my degree in Computing at ALU which is in partnership with Glagow Caledinian
                                                University based in Scotland and set to complete it in 2024. I am still figuring my life out so best
                                                believe, i dont know what im doing.

                                                I studied in multiple institutions in South Africa before finally coming to Mauritius, The university of
                                                Pretoria being my first and Worst experience but came with a lot of lessons. I was able to get a Higher 
                                                Certificate in Industrial Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology prior to coming to ALU.

                                                I am a lover of life and everything beautiful. I like partyinga and eexploring but easily lose interest.
                                                I have a good record of starting anything, but not so much of completing or implementing. In all honesty
                                                I don't know what im called for or set to do academically and career wise but i do know im passionate about
                                                giving back and helping others by all means, especially people who have been through the same or similar
                                                circumstances to mine.

                                        <p>
                                            I can describe myself as a happy person that is easily prone to sadness.
                                            I am always eager to learn new skills as i currently am doing by pursuing
                                            Computing, especially if i know they will come in handy in the near future.
                                            In my current degree I enjoy Front-end design and development, i find it 
                                            tiring but interesting. I struggle a lot with Programming but i always
                                            pull through. 

                                            I did Informatics in 2017 and fell inlove with data analysis and critical
                                            thinking.Ideating and formulating solutions comes really easy to me, I 
                                            highly recommend myself when it comes to problem solving.

                                                ALU was a full package, it came with everything i needed and wanted.
                                                Studying on an island at all expenses paid was not a deal i could
                                                decline. 
                                                The marketing was also quiet convincing. I wanted to be part of the

                                                I was mostly excited about exploring my leadership skills and allowing
                                                myself to learn new things.

                                                I found the application process really easy to get through
                                                and basically completed it in like an hour or so in my bed
                                                using midnight data. The reply was also really timely so I was
                                                able to apply for a scholarship which was also straight forward
                                                and took under 28hrs to get all my documents in order for the 
                                                application. I later got awarded a mastercard scholarship which 
                                                meant all my studying costs were covered.

                                                I have to admit I was really excited and greatful for the 
                                                opprtunity i was awarded and could not wait to get to campus.

                                            <p>
                                                Travelling to ALU was one of the longest and hardest journey
                                                I ever took in my life. I first tested positive for covid
                                                when i had to travel. I travelled late and had to stay in
                                                a different country for two weeks because i was South African.
                                                I stayed 14days in Rwanda then could not board in Kenya because 
                                                the Airline thought it was a risk to let me board with exactly 
                                                14 days out of SA. I got stuck in Kenya for another 2weeks
                                                because i tested positive for Covid and actually got sick.

                                                I arrived in Mauritius after a whole Month on road and still 
                                                has to go through mandatory quarantine for another 14days.
                                                I finally got to the ALC campus and felt relieved after the 
                                                long journey.

                                            
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>The ALU Experience!</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The campus was not what I expected in terms of Infrastructure.
                                                It looks way smaller in person and not exactly like the 
                                                mareting team sells us. Meeting new people was really 
                                                interesting since everyone was smart and unique in their own
                                                way. It was kind of intimidating but pursuaded me to a journey
                                                of self discovery and seeing room for growth in most aspects of
                                                my life.

                                                I could visualise the ALU vision but not really sure if i could
                                                feel and experience it. The leadership aspect was explored but
                                                not to my satisfaction and everything else seemed like a blur and
                                                an experiment at work.

                                                The education system seemed a bit unstable and inconsistent which
                                                raised a lot of ears and some worry. Learning with doubts caused 
                                                a lot of confusion for most of us and left us with a lot of questions.
                                                I believe im still learning about how the institution functions and can
                                                understand it to a point, but otherwise i can say I was challenged a 
                                                lot intellectually and mentally. I call myself a survivor for having
                                                gone through the last 2 years without falling into depression.

                                                actually means exactly that. Be open minded and leave a lot of

                                                    I carried out the awards ceremony at my school among other events i co-hosted on campus.

                                                    a work-study intenship in my secon year and it was a fruitful
                                                    experience. Not only did I sharpen my leadership skills
                                                    but I worked and grew relationships with amazing people
                                                    and also learned a lot about myself.

                                                I think we can all agree that the covid lockdowns were the worst
                                                and as the human population we certainly deserved better than that.
                                                It was my second birthday to celebrate during a lockdown because
                                                Mauritius was facing its first major Covid outbreak, one that I
                                                had already experienced a year before in South Africa. I did not let 
                                                that hold me back, instead I threw a party and celebrated my birthday
                                                with everyone on campus. It was thoroughly enjoyed and everyone was
                                                able to unwind and forget about schoolwork for a while. Made new 
                                                friends, had a great time, woould do it again.
