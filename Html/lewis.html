                                         My name is Lewis Ndahinyuka, and I was born and raised in Kigali, Rwanda. 
                                         I'm a professional software engineer with expertise working with a variety of frameworks and programming languages.
                                         I'm interested programming in general and penetration testing. I have worked with languages such as C and C++, Java, python, and JavaScript,
                                         and I'm also specializing in React development, Since I'm a good designer, 
                                         I like to focus on front-end development in my regular software development projects. However, 
                                         I have plans to expand my back-end skills and possibly become a full stack developer.
                                            </strong>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>In addition to programming, I enjoy playing with networking devices, 
                                        which inspired me to study various networking tools and begin my hacking journey.
                                        At the moment, I'm attempting to teach myself various penetration techniques, 
                                        which I will be employing with Python in my regular penetration testing activities.

                                                <strong>Why ALU?</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                When I was looking for a university,
                                                ALU was my ideal choice since it had a strong commitment to changing Africa by developing young Africans into future leaders.
                                                I was always saddened by how other continents perceive Africa and wanted to do my tiny part to help change that.
                                                That’s what inspired me to apply to ALU
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Application Process!</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Before attending ALU, I frequently enrolled in short courses to keep myself in the software engineering field. 
                                                I heard about ALU from a friend and decided to apply, the tuition was a bit higher than I could afford,
                                                so I decided to defer my application. Later, in 2020, I heard about scholarships offered by ALU, so I reapplied,
                                                finally I was awarded a full scholarship.
                                                
                                                honestly I wasn't expecting to be chosen,i was all good memories.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Travelling to ALU </strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It was difficult to travel to ALU during those difficult years (19). Different paperwork are required to enter each country,
                                                and we were not permitted to leave our houses throughout the Covid period,
                                                It was difficult to obtain the paperwork since so many of them required you to participate in the procedure in person, 
                                                but I was able to obtain them.
                                                
                                                Other than those difficulties, it was a wonderful experience. I was quite happy because it was my first time traveling, 
                                                but the experience was not exactly what I had anticipated but it was good.
                                            
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>The ALU Experience!</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                
                                         My time at ALU and at Mauritius in general have been incredible; 
                                         I've made many friends who we share the same desire to see our continent changed, 
                                         and I've also learned a lot from first year, including life experience, work experience, 
                                         and a lot that helped me develop a strong mindset. I would say that my time at ALU has been beneficial overall,
                                         I couldn't complain

                                                    I used to search on Google to look for information on the campus and see how it looked before coming, 
                                                    so when I arrived, my expectations were different from what I actually saw.
                                                    The worst part about the campus is where it is located. It is located far from of the city, 
                                                    which I didn't like. The campus is extremely small, 
                                                    and the number of students who stays there is actually quite little, 
                                                    sometimes it feels empty and boring. Some of the most incredible moments I've had on campus so far include partying,
                                                    hanging out with friends, and playing games, especially basketball.

                                                    but I have gone to several beautiful beaches. Life on the beaches is so fun and entertaining

                                                I think we can all agree that the covid lockdowns were the worst
                                                and as the human population we certainly deserved better than that.
                                                It was my second birthday to celebrate during a lockdown because
                                                Mauritius was facing its first major Covid outbreak, one that I
                                                had already experienced a year before in South Africa. I did not let 
                                                that hold me back, instead I threw a party and celebrated my birthday
                                                with everyone on campus. It was thoroughly enjoyed and everyone was
                                                able to unwind and forget about schoolwork for a while. Made new 
                                                friends, had a great time, woould do it again.

                                                times. Hosting Events and offering entertainment at a price is worth it
                                                if it is Omian. Time and again I find myself using Opportunity given
                                                to have a good time with friendly faces in a safe and inclusive environment.
                                                meet new people from other universities and just engage on anything and 
                                                everything, establish connections and relax over a good glass of mocktal.

                                                   I love programming, and I'm interested in leveraging my knowledge of it to address a variety of local and global issues.
                                                                 I'm a software engineer with expertise working with a variety of frameworks and programming languages.
                                                                 I'm interested in programming in general and penetration testing. I have worked with languages such as C and C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, 
                                                                 and I'm also specializing in React development, Since I'm a good designer, 
                                                                 I like to focus on front-end development in my regular software development projects. 
                                                                 However, I have plans to expand my back-end skills and possibly become a full-stack developer. 
                                                                 In addition to programming, I enjoy playing with networking devices,

                                                                 At the moment, I'm attempting to teach myself various penetration techniques,

                                                                 I'm currently working on a variety of projects, including websites and mobile platforms.
