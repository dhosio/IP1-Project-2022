						                    My name is Victory Friday from Rivers State, Nigeria.
						                    I lived in Port-Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State. 
						                    My hometown is Khana LGA in Rivers State.
						                    I completed junior and senior high school in Faasaa Comprehensive College 
						                    in Port-Harcourt Nigeria.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>ALU Application</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            I heard about ALU on Twitter when Patoranking posted about it.
						                    I wanted to study at ALU because I liked the Pan-Africanism it represented 
						                    and I thought it was one of the first of its kind.
						                    I started the application process late December and after passing the first
						                    hurdle - the leadership quiz, I was excited. I continued in early January 
						                    and did not finish until the end of March or so. 
						                    Then began the long process of waiting. I was accepted on conditional 
							                admission in late April pending my submission of a particular document.
						                    I submitted the document and was finally fully admitted in late May. 

                                            </p>

                                            <!-- Q3 -->

                                            <p>
                                            Moving to ALU for studies was an exciting, life-changing experience for me.
						                    Being someone that had never moved out of my home country before ALU,
						                    it was everything I thought it would be and more.
						                    Meeting other students was an exciting and fulfilling experience
						                    especially meeting the ones who I was already in contact with and 
						                    had caught glimpses of on ALU's page.

                                                <strong>Class Experience</strong>
						                    The classes we studied in ALU especially during our first year,
						                    were very practical and what we need for real life and in each of our careers. 
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>Advice to prospective students</strong>
						                    I would advice prospective students to choose a course that 
						                    will be beneficial to them in the future and to choose ALU 
						                    because it is one of the best decisions you would make.

                                            I am not a really social person but thanks to my internship,
                                            I had the opportunity to do a few things one would consider fun on
                                            the island. I went on a boat cruise to a private island where I had one
                                            the most exhilarating experiences in Mauritius. I enjoyed good food,
                                            company and most exciting the sunset on a private boat where I 
                                            could the sun in its beautiful color on the surface of the waters

							                I love the idea of renewable energy. I love the towering view 
							                of the turbines (or power tree as I'll like to call it) and the 
							                idea of it generating electricity. Most especially, I liked watching 
                                            the turbines until I felt they were moving in my direction somehow 🤭😍
                                            I love the sound of nature and the temperature of the cave with the mosses,
                                            algae, cobwebs, and mostly it's thick appealing darkness. Ever walked through a cave?
                                            Horrible as it sounds, it appeals to me. And yea, I didn't like the bats too 
                                            much but I figure it's all part of the thrill.

                                            Nature is S O L A C E.
                                            And like they say "a walk in nature walks the soul back home"✨

                                            Securing an internship was a challenging and eye-opening experience for me.
						                    Coupling moving off campus and having a job that treats me more like a staff 
						                    plus having an internship. It was an experience that came with mixed feelings.
						                    I have however enjoyed the experience so far as I have been able to socialise 
						                    more and built relationships that are crucial to my career and future.

                                        Being an IT Intern has been a thrilling and fidgety experience for me.
						                I have been made to work tirelessly and without relent for the past two 
						                months and this is my final month. Being a startup, I do not focus on
						                only the grueling tasks of constantly updating websites, writing blogs
						                and contents, but have also been directly involved in the daily activities
						                of the company. I have even led projects and completed tasks daily that I 
						                thought I would not have been able to finish in a week. It has however
						                opened my mind and broadened my knowledge as to how things work in a 
						                corporate organisation intoto.

						                I am interested in bringing more women into STEM especially tech.
						                I will use my skills to help the women by providing an app or building 
						                an online school that teaches women coding for free or at zero cost.
						                I would also be contributing to Open source communities (I have already 
						                started but I intend to do it on a larger scale) such as Linux, Google, etc 
						                and for other start-up companies. 
						                I would like to build an app/website that enhances people's fashion sense - not
						                just physically but for our environment as well.
